# DIFI-7 IONOSPHERE MAGNETIC FIELD MODEL

The Dedicated Ionospheric Field Inversion (DIFI) model is a Swarm-based, global model of the Sq and equatorial electrojet magnetic fields at mid and low-latitudes. It describes variations with local time, season and solar flux and separates primary and induced magnetic fields.


## Run the DIFI Module with Python

- DIFI need to be compiled in Python2.7 environment. 
- There is `examples.py` provides the example to use the module.
